            <p>Reports of a break-in within the local community are circulating like wildfire. Residents are advised to lock their doors at night and take proper security measures to ensure the safety of themselves and their belongings. Police reports indicate that the primary suspect of the recent burglaries is a 31 year old Caucasian male by the name of Norman Osborne. Osborne is said to have had multiple encounters with law enforcement through crimes such as repeated breaking and entering, theft of personal belongings, and resisting arrest. We can see that this man has a long list of crimes and clearly doesn’t intend on stopping soon, so definitely be sure to keep an eye out for this man. If you do end up seeing him, be sure to stay away and alert the authorities from a safe distance. This is Austin News Network, reporting live on local happenings.</p>

            <p>A poor, homeless man by the name of Norman Osborn was arrested last night after stealing $5 worth of bread for his starving children. Osborn felt deep regret after stealing to feed his family and went back to the shop to apologize. He is presently in jail as he could not pay the court costs. Osborn is a desperate, single father trying his best to provide for his children. He struggles daily to supply the basic necessities for him and his family. He is currently unemployed, which is why he resorted to stealing, but is actively job searching. Osborn’s main concern at the moment is that he can not be with his three children who are ages 3, 5 and 8. This issue is much bigger than a small act of theft. It is about the abandonment of the poor and less fortunate. This is Austin News Network, reporting live on local happenings.</p>
