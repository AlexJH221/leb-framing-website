            <p>What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word frame? Most likely it is a picture frame or the wooden frame of a house being constructed. The frame of a painting provides structure to support the canvas, and it helps to set the tone and present the painting to look more appealing. </p>

            <p>Similarly, the framing of a house in construction creates a rigid structure for the building to be fleshed out from, and someone can also infer the remaining details of the house largely just by looking at the frame.</p>

            <p>The definition of framing easily fits in with these thoughts of physical construction. In fact, it is so easy to understand that Dictionary.com has it labeled as an “elementary level” word.</p>

        <p>However, there is a deeper side to framing that many people may miss. Framing can also represent a process done to less concrete and more abstract topics.</p>
        <p>Someone with a more devious mind might lean to the act of framing someone for a crime, where reality is distorted and lies are told in order to make people believe someone committed a crime that another did.</p>
        <p>Putting these different examples together we can form an understanding of the schema of interpretation that is framing in terms of ethics. Take how a picture frame provides the context to the painting, the frame of a house can help to interpret what the final building will look like, and how the crime of framing someone can alter the way others view an event or person. All these happen when the context of an event is described differently in order to stir up different reactions.</p>
        <p>Framing occurs in our mind through learned and instinctive thought patterns that alter the way we view decisions we must make or assorted scenarios. Bredeson gives us the example of an Enron employee flaunting himself going against a new policy of cutting back travel examples because he believed he deserved it for how hard he had been working. This was a way of rationalizing spending the company's money. Another way to view this is as it being a negative thing because the company needs to save money in order to survive, so he should help the company instead of rewarding himself. These rationales are not mutually exclusive, so without altering the facts in any way people can come to different conclusions based on how they process the situation. By altering the context in which something is corrected we can create biases within our own thought process, or we can draw people to a conclusion we want. Framing is a powerful tool used to persuade oneself or other people and we must be aware of it by talking to people or researching sources with different perspectives.</p>
